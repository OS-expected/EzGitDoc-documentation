EzGitDoc is open source, WYSIWYG tool designed to improve Git documentation experience. It allows to generate <code>*.md</code> file structure within projected template at <a href="https://trolit.github.io/EzGitDoc/"><em>https://trolit.github.io/EzGitDoc/</em></a>. You don't need to install anything as the project is setup and ready to use on github-pages. Every element's data can be modified after rendering it on page except image/kbd/linked kbd table(still with those table types you can quickly change images resolutions). Make prototype of your document, fill in data whenever you want, get ouput and polish it to your needs. Reduce to 0 the risk of elements not being rendered as expected with EzGitDoc :)

### Pros of EzGitDoc

#### üî∏ Less writing more clicking

<p align="justify">
<small>
The most important advantage of EzGitDoc solution. You don't have to spend extra time on working with markup. Try certain elements with more clicking than writing by giving required basic data. If you want to fill in data during the process of making prototype, you only need to specify content of elements. Markup is handled by EzGitDoc.

</p>

#### üî∏ Easy to understand & use

<p align="justify">
<small>
Because of minimalistic UI, you don't need to spend time on EzGitDoc documentation to get started(if you don't want to). You can learn interface instantly. Try to render elements and then see how complete prototype looks on any page that supports *.md files to document repositories.

</p>

#### üî∏ Well documented

<p align="justify">
<small>
If you prefer reading documentation first, EzGitDoc has extensive documentation about it's changes, explanations and examples on how to handle different situations. If you won't find what you need, feel free to message me through Discord(<a  href="#-well-documented">trol_IT#8002</a>) or by leaving issue <a href="https://github.com/trolit/EzGitDoc/issues">here</a>. I will be glad to help üêç

#### üî∏ Customizable

<p align="justify">
<small>
EzGitDoc allows to personalize some settings which you might find comfortable to use like automated modals or notifications auto hide.
</small>
</p>

#### üî∏ Validated

<p align="justify">
<small>
For each element that can be added, there are some limits and expectations under specific data that must be filled in. Fields are labelled with required/optional notes. If one of the fields won't be filled in as expected, you will receive easy notification on what needs to be fixed in order to render element.
</small>
</p>

#### üî∏ Fast

<p align="justify">
<small>
Following the first advantage it's a lot faster to create element structure giving only basic info and clicking create than writing element from scratch. If you only want to project structure of document, check Quickbuilder that comes with EzGitDoc.
