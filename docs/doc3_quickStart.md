</p>

<p align="justify">
To reset prototype(clear all created elements) you need to click red button placed below EzGitDoc logo in the sidebar. This operation needs to be confirmed, so don't worry if you click it by mistake. 
<br/><br/>
In the bottom part of the sidebar there are 4 buttons(icons) that perform different operations. First one(eye icon) allows you to close sidebar to preview prototype, double up/down arrow on click slide to the top/bottom of the project. Last one(gear) opens modal with settings that can be adjusted.

</p>

<p align="justify">

</p>

:::tip
If you plan on making more than one change it's worth to use update button oftenly because if you click outside the modal it disappears. Uncommited changes won't be saved and when you toggle update on the same element again, modal will be rerendered from current element state.
