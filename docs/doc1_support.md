#### Browser

<p align="justify">
It is recommended to use modern browser in order to get maximum functionality out of the project. EzGitDoc uses for example classList(HTML DOM property) which is not working on every browser version. According to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_classlist.asp">w3schools</a> documentation you must have at least Chrome 8, IE10, Firefox 3.6, Safari 5.1 or Opera 11.5 in order to properly use all implemented EzGitDoc functions.

#### Device

<p align="justify">
EzGitDoc user interface(UI) is built with MDBootstrap framework that allows to make the page react very nice on different screens(act responsively). However, the project was created with purpose to be used on devices like PC, notebooks. The most effective(quick and comfortable) way to use EzGitDoc will be through device with bigger screen than e.g. smartphone to develop repository documentation.
